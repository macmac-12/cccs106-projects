## Programs Created

### 1. hello_world.py
- **Status:** ✅ Completed
- **Features:** Student info display, age calculation, system info
- **Notes:** At first, it did not work because the python interpreter is not working, then I made another environment and worked.

### 2. basic_calculator.py
- **Status:** ✅ Completed
- **Features:** Basic arithmetic, error handling, min/max calculation
- **Notes:** Did not have any challenges, I just did what was told for the test cases.

## Challenges and Solutions

I had the difficulty running my codes because I did not follow the instructions so I tried doing the tasks from the start and it finally worked.

## Learning Outcomes

I have learned that it is important to know the basics of python as this would be the foundation of a developer. Making a virtual environment is not easy and it is also not hard, it is just important to follow instructions and to understand them.
