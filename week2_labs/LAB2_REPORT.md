**Student Name:** Mark Vincent S. Rana
**Student ID:** 231004379
**Section:** BSCS 3A
**Date:** September 3, 2025

## Git Configuration

### Repository Setup
- **GitHub Repository:** (https://github.com/macmac-12/cccs106-projects)
- **Local Repository:** ✅ Initialized and connected
- **Commit History:** Excluding merges, 1 author has pushed 6 commits to main and 6 commits to all branches. On main, 0 files have changed and there have been 0 additions and 0 deletions.

### Git Skills Demonstrated
- ✅ Repository initialization and configuration
- ✅ Adding, committing, and pushing changes
- ✅ Branch creation and merging
- ✅ Remote repository management

## Flet GUI Applications

### 1. hello_flet.py
- **Status:** ✅ Completed
- **Features:** Interactive greeting, student info display, dialog boxes
- **UI Components:** Text, TextField, Buttons, Dialog, Containers
- **Notes:** I had the difficulty of how to run using VSC and tried running the application using cmd and it worked, so I asked a classmate and figured out that I need to delete and create visual environment.

### 2. personal_info_gui.py
- **Status:** ✅ Completed
- **Features:** Form inputs, dropdowns, radio buttons, profile generation
- **UI Components:** TextField, Dropdown, RadioGroup, Containers, Scrolling
- **Error Handling:** Input validation and user feedback
- **Notes:** Had no difficulty since the issue was resolved on the first application -- hello_flet.py.

## Technical Skills Developed

### Git Version Control
- Understanding of repository concepts
- Basic Git workflow (add, commit, push)
- Branch management and merging
- Remote repository collaboration

### Flet GUI Development
- Flet 0.28.3 syntax and components
- Page configuration and layout management
- Event handling and user interaction
- Modern UI design principles

## Challenges and Solutions

The challenges that I encountered was stated already on the notes of 1.hello_flet.py. I also had a difficulty understanding the commit, add and push in git but thanks to Mr. Ricafort, I understand some of them.

## Learning Outcomes

I learned that version control, GUI development, and collaborative programming are closely connected—version control helps organize and track changes, GUI development emphasizes building user-friendly interfaces, and collaboration ensures smooth teamwork through communication and coordination. Together, these skills taught me how technical tools and teamwork combine to create efficient, user-focused projects.

## Future Enhancements

I want to make this a Personal Information Manager for an organization to easily monitor the information of the members. I want also to enhance it that when generated, it was already uploaded to the data of the website.
